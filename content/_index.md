On March 13, 1938, the incorporation of the previously Austrofascist-ruled Austria into the National Socialist German Reich, commonly referred to as the "Anschluss", was declared by law. One day earlier, German troops crossed the border into Austria. On April 10, 1938, the "Law on the Reunification of Austria with the German Reich" was recognised through a plebiscite accompanied by propaganda. 
The surviving files on National Socialist crimes in Austria can be found in numerous archives, research institutions and memorial sites. Among other things, EHRI-AT is working to make this source material in Austria discoverable and accessible through a national digital Holocaust research infrastructure.
