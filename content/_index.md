description: Welcome to the Austrian Holocaust Research Infrastructure

Austria was occupied by the German Reich in March 1938 and annexed following a referendum. It was incorporated into the general administration of the German Reich in 1939 and divided into Reich districts. 
In numerous state archives of the Austrian provinces, in research institutions in memorial sites, there are surviving files of the central and provincial administrations as well as files of the judicial prosecution of National Socialist crimes in Austria. EHRI-AT is working on finding and linking this source material in Austria through a national digital Holocaust research infrastructure.
