<p class="intro">
    The <a href="https://www.ehri-project.eu">European Holocaust Research Infrastructure (EHRI)</a> is an international infrastructure
    securing Holocaust research, commemoration and education on a trans-national level.
    EHRI-UK is the national node representing the United Kingdom within this international
    research consortium.
</p>

<h3>EHRI-UK will seek to ensure the long-term sustainability of Holocaust research within the UK and beyond by:</h3>

<ul>
    <li>representing institutions within the UK (and Crown Dependencies) which contain materials related to Holocaust
        Studies to create a strong research consortium;</li>
    <li>connecting resources through a state-of-the-art digital infrastructure;</li>
    <li>developing innovative digital research tools;</li>
    <li>offering fellowships and training opportunities for researchers, archivists, and heritage professionals.</li>
</ul>

<p>
    EHRI's impact is primarily scientific, however, the infrastructure also advances a wider
    social and political agenda. The recent rise of antisemitism, xenophobia and aggressive
    nationalisms in Europe and beyond demonstrate that Holocaust research is never a purely
    academic concern, but a prerequisite for open and non-discriminatory societies across
    Europe and beyond.
