{{< intro >}}
The [European Holocaust Research Infrastructure (EHRI)](https://www.ehri-project.eu) is an international infrastructure that supports and promotes Holocaust research, commemoration and education on a transnational level. EHRI-AT is the national node representing the Federal Republic of Austria within this international research consortium.

EHRI-AT will seek to ensure the long-term sustainability of Holocaust research within Austria and beyond by:

<br/><br/> 

•	representing institutions in Austria working in the field of documentation, commemoration and research on the Holocaust to establish and develop a strong research consortium;\
•	exchanging and sharing expertise on digital developments and connecting resources through a state-of-the-art digital infrastructure;\
•	disseminating, implementing and developing innovative digital research tools;\
•	offering fellowships and training opportunities for researchers, archivists and heritage professionals.

<br/><br/>
EHRI’s impact is primarily scientific; however, the infrastructure also pursues a broader social and political agenda. The recent rise of antisemitism, xenophobia and aggressive nationalisms in Europe and beyond demonstrate that Holocaust research is never a purely academic concern but a prerequisite for open and non-discriminatory societies across Europe and the world.

The EHRI portal is one of the central projects in EHRI. It is intended to provide researchers with a cross-national overview of archive material on the Holocaust. Since 2010, EHRI has identified over 2,233 archives from 63 countries and integrated information on over 37,000 collections. The need for such an infrastructure in Austria was already recognised by Simon Wiesenthal in the 1960s. He worked in Vienna with the Documentation Center of the Association of Jewish Persecutees of the Nazi Regime on a "List of Archives with Material on the Nazi Era". The brochure was intended to support the work of courts and researchers. Lists of archives in Czechoslovakia, Israel and West Germany were compiled for this purpose. As can be seen from the following quote, there were striking similarities between Wiesenthal's project and the digital EHRI portal.

"_21. LIST OF ARCHIVES WITH DOCUMENTS ABOUT THE NAZI PERIOD._

_A second list, namely that of archives organised by country with details about their holdings, is being prepared. It will be sent to the interested parties in the respective countries. So far we have finalised the lists of archives in Czechoslovakia, Israel and West Germany. When the work will be finished, the Documentation Centre will publish a special brochure. It will be of use to courts, historians and researchers, as we endeavour to indicate the type of documents contained in the archives when providing their addresses._"
