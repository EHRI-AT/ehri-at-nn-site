The edited volume *Connected Histories. Memories and Narratives in Digital Space* has been published in the DeGruyter [Studies in Digital History and Hermeneutics](https://www.degruyter.com/serial/sdhh-b/html). Contributions are based on the first EHRI-AT Conference and explore how the history of the Holocaust and its commemoration are produced, staged and framed in the World Wide Web â€“ by memorials, by research institutions and by individual users.
