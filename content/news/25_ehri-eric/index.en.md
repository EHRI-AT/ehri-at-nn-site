On 26 January 2025 – on the eve of the 80th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz-Birkenau – EHRI was launched as an ERIC. This [European Research Infrastructure Consortium](https://research-and-innovation.ec.europa.eu/news/all-research-and-innovation-news/european-holocaust-research-infrastructure-becomes-30th-eu-recognised-research-consortium-major-2025-01-20_en) (ERIC) will form a solid foundation for future Holocaust research and documentation in Europe and beyond. The inauguration ceremony took place in the POLIN Museum in Warsaw and was attended by representatives of the 10 founding members, long-term EHRI project members, members of the national nodes and the wider EHRI-community.
In their speeches the official representatives highlighted the importance of Holocaust research and documentation in the fight against Holocaust distortion, in the education of empathic young adults, in combatting antisemitism and other forms of racism and in protecting the facts. With the rise of right-wing nationalism, populism and illiberal politics in many European countries, the protection of academic freedom will be at the core of what EHRI-ERIC stands for. Austria is one of the founding members – the VWI as coordinating institution of EHRI-AT is looking forward to work with its Austrian partners in order to secure transnational research and documentation.
