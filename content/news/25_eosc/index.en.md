In 2024, the EHRI team at the VWI was interviewed by the Horizon Europe Projects TETTRIs & Skills4EOSC as part of a case study on “Open Collections Supporting Policy Goals”, the results of this exchange were included in a brochure on “[Advancing evidence-based policymaking through Open Collections and Open Science Principles](https://verlag.nhm-wien.ac.at/buecher/2024_Skills4Eosc_Booklet.pdf)”. The objective of this case study is to demonstrate how Open Collections, through the European Holocaust Research Infrastructure (EHRI) and the Vienna Wiesenthal Institute for Holocaust Studies (VWI), facilitate enhanced access to Holocaust-related resources while supporting evidence-based policymaking.
