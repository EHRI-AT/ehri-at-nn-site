    The VWI is an international research institute in Vienna. The Institute's documentation activities focus on archival collections, which include the Holocaust-related parts of the archives of the Jewish Community (IKG) – as a loan to the VWI, the estate of Simon Wiesenthal with its extensive holdings on Nazi perpetrators, private collections acquired by researchers and the Institute's library. Research projects are realised on the basis of this documentation, and the results are published in academic publications. Since its foundation in 2012, the VWI Fellowship Program has combined international Holocaust research with local knowledge and expertise. As part of its educational and outreach work, guided tours of the in-house museum are offered on a regular basis.
    The VWI has set itself the task of passing on Wiesenthal's legacy. Through lectures, film screenings and discussions, it aims to encourage the wider public to deal with antisemitism, racism as well as the commemoration of the Holocaust and genocide. 
    The VWI has been a partner institution of EHRI since 2010, with core activities in the organisation of training events, Conny Kristel Fellowships, the EHRI Document Blog and the development of a research agenda for the future of EHRI-ERIC. Within the framework of EHRI-ERIC, the VWI will coordinate the activities of EHRI-AT.

    The DÖW has extensive archive material on the Nazi era. The holdings include police and judicial files on resistance and persecution between 1934–1938 and 1938–1945, criminal proceedings against Nazi perpetrators as well as personal files and estates. The special collections include a photo archive, an archive of Austrians who fought in the Spanish Civil War, a poster collection, a pamphlet collection, an interview collection, an art collection and documents on right-wing extremism in post-war Austria. The archives have been processed electronically and are being digitised on an ongoing basis.

    The Institute for Jewish History in Austria (Injoest) was established during the so-called “Bedenkjahr” or “Year of Reflection” in 1988 and is currently housed in the cantor's house of the former synagogue in St. Pölten. Its mission is to comprehensively research the history and culture of the Jews – as well as topics and themes constructed or labelled as Jewish – in the historically relevant boundaries of Austria from the Middle Ages to the present day. Other tasks include the reproduction and digital accessibility of pre-modern primary sources and organising publication and lecture activities, university teaching, as well as citizen science, school projects and commemorative cultural activities.
    Since 2018, Injoest has been placing Stones of Remembrance for the victims of the Shoah at the destroyed IKG St. Pölten. The virtual memorial book (juden-in-st-poelten.at) is a contact point for international enquiries. Looking to the future, Injoest will manage the Lower Austrian content for the "Digital Remembrance Landscape" (DERLA) and also represent the region for ERINNERN:AT. The staff of Injoest will serve as scientific advisors for the exhibitions and events organised by the Former Synagogue, which will be reopened in 2024 as a cultural centre of the NÖKU.

    Beginning in 1898, the castle of Hartheim served as a care centre for people with disabilities. From 1940 to 1945, the castle was home to a Nazi euthanasia centre where almost 30,000 people were murdered using carbon monoxide. The victims were residents of sanatoriums, nursing homes and care facilities; concentration camp prisoners from the Mauthausen, Gusen, Dachau and Ravensbrück camps who were unable to work; as well as other forced labourers.
    After 1945, the castle was used as a residential building for decades, and in 1969, the owner – the Upper Austrian “Landeswohltätigkeitsverein” – opened the first memorial rooms.
    In 1995, the Schloss Hartheim Association was founded with the aim of creating an appropriate place of remembrance, commemoration and social dialogue. In 2003, the memorial site and the "Value of Life" exhibition were established as a place of learning and remembrance at Schloss Hartheim. The new permanent exhibition opened its doors in 2021.
    The place of learning and remembrance offers visitors an extensive range of educational programmes. The Hartheim Documentation Centre is the point of contact for information and research.

    The National Fund of the Republic of Austria for Victims of National Socialism was established in 1995 to express the special responsibility of the Republic of Austria towards the victims of National Socialism. It provides benefits to victims of National Socialism, in particular persons who received no or completely inadequate compensation, those who are in particular need of assistance or for whom support appears justified due to their life situation.
    Other tasks of the National Fund are also tied to the Republic’s special responsibility, such as the redesign and supervision of the Austrian exhibition in Auschwitz-Birkenau, the awarding of the Simon Wiesenthal Prize or performing tasks related to the restitution of looted art or the maintenance of the Shoah Wall of Names Memorial in Vienna.
    In 2001, the Washington Agreement between Austria and the United States created the basis for restitution and compensation measures through two funds administered by the National Fund: the General Settlement Fund for Victims of National Socialism, and the Fund for the Restoration of the Jewish Cemeteries in Austria.
    A particular concern of the National Fund is the promotion and dissemination of knowledge about National Socialism, its consequences and the fate of its victims, as well as the preservation of the memory of the victims. The National Fund also supports memorial service volunteers and international exchange programmes for young people.
